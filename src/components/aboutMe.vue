                    Hi there, my name is Yingxiaoyang Hu, but you can call me
                    Shawn.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Who Am I?

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Other than my name, I've been called many things, a dreamer,
                    an ambitious person, and most recently, an entrepreneur.
                    However, my proudest title would have to be a
                    <strong>problem solver</strong>. As a computer science
                    student at the University of Toronto, this could not have
                    been a better compliment.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The purpose of this website is to provide an overview of who
                    I am and what I have done. I will also be updating it with
                    new projects. Please feel free to explore and make any
                    suggestions you have.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Hopefully, my work will intrigue you. ðŸ˜€

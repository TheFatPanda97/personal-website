                <p class="about-content">
                    Hi there, my name is Yingxiaoyang Hu, but you can call me
                    Shawn.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Who Am I?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Other than my name, I've been called many things, a dreamer,
                    <br />
                    an ambitious person, and most recently, an entrepreneur.
                    However,
                    <br />
                    my proudest title would have to be a
                    <strong>problem solver</strong>. As a computer science
                    <br />
                    student at the University of Toronto, this could not have
                    been a better
                    <br />
                    compliement. The purpose of this website is to provide an
                    overview of who
                    <br />
                    I am and what I have done.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope some of my work will intrigue you. ðŸ˜€

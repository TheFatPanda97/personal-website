Hi there, my name is Yingxiaoyang Hu, but you can call me Shawn.

Who Am I?

Other than my name, I've been called many things, a dreamer,
an ambitious person, and most recently, an entrepreneur.
However,
my proudest title would have to be a
<strong>problem solver</strong>. As a computer science
student at the University of Toronto, this could not have
been a better
compliement. The purpose of this website is to provide an
overview of who
I am and what I have done.
I hope some of my work will intrigue you. ðŸ˜€
